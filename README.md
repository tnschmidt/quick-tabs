# quick-tabs
Quick Tabs is a very simple bare bones jQuery plugin to implement tabs on a page. Style the tabs how you would like.

See the example.html file to get an idea of how you should structure your tabs. 

- Use the '.quick-tabs' class as a wrapper around the tabs list and tabs content.
- Use an the '.quick-tabs-nav' as a class for the html list for the tab names/clickable tabs. 
- Use the '.quick-tabs-content' to wrap where the content of each tab will be, with a <div> wrapping each tab content.
